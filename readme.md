In this project, I am trying to mine twitter to get likeness of an object by general twitter users.
This would help me in getting some accurate trends (relying on twitter feeds) to get for ex: new Books being 
read by people or how a particular movie is doing ? How general public is reacting to a new product launch.
By following a particular store, I should be abe to learn any new product launch and it's reaction to the public.

These are some of the crude ideas I am thinking and would eventually augment this readme as I progress with the project.

Requirement :
Python 3.0.
Tweepy 3.0
Twitter API account. 
scikit, panadas etc for further analysis and learning.
